# This plugin collects some data like the online players, 
# ip address, port, etc. so I can visit your server. To see what you do with my plugin helps 
# me to motivate myself to continue to develop this plugin. This system also allows me to enable premium 
# features remotely. (Only enabling not disabling) If you don't want that 
# just set "enabled" to false. All collected data will be deleted automatically 
# after a restart or after the plugin hasn't been started for 2 weeks. If you don't see 
# an installId in this file, no data has been sent or all collected data has been deleted.
# Thanks for using this plugin!
